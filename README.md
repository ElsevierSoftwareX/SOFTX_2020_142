# EaRL
Software for Earthquake Risk, Loss &amp; Lifecycle Assessment

EaRL is an open source MATLAB-based software for earthquake risk, loss and lifecycle Analysis. EaRL provides an interactive and user-friendly platform for evaluating the consequences of natural hazards in general, and seismic hazard in particular, on the built environment and communities, in support of the performance-based earthquake engineering framework. The software platform is meant to assist engineers, stakeholders, (re-) insurers and building owners make informed design/retrofit decisions to mitigate the impact of earthquake hazard on the built infrastructure and potentially optimize the seismic lifecycle performance of infrastructure assets. This is supported by a comprehensive library for visualizing and reporting the disaggregated economic losses. Being an open-source software, EaRL paves the way for researchers and practicing engineers worldwide to collaborate and contribute to its metadata, functionalities and interactive features. The choice of the versatile Matlab and GitHub environments, in addition to the softwareâ€™s well-documented technical details and codebase, will hopefully stimulate further developments in support of performance-based design.
