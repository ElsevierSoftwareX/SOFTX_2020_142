# EaRL

EaRL is an open source MATLAB-based platform/software for earthquake risk, loss and lifecycle Analysis. EaRL provides an interactive and user-friendly platform for evaluating the consequences of natural hazards in general, and seismic hazard in particular, on the built environment and communities, in support of the performance-based earthquake engineering framework (e.g., FEMA P-58). The platform is supported by a comprehensive library for visualizing and reporting the disaggregated economic losses. Being an open-source software, EaRL paves the way for researchers and practicing engineers worldwide to collaborate and contribute to its metadata, functionalities and interactive features. This is supported by MATLAB and GitHub environments, in addition to the softwareâ€™s well-documented technical details and codebase.
